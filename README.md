# ðŸŽ­ useBroadcastChannel ðŸŽ­
By creating a BroadcastChannel object, you can receive any messages that are posted to it. You don't have to maintain a reference to the frames or workers you wish to communicate with: they can "subscribe" to a particular channel by constructing their own BroadcastChannel with the same name, and have bi-directional communication between all of them.

const handler = () => {
    post(count + 1)
    setCount(count => count + 1)
}
```
